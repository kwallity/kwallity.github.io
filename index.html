      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Born and raised in central Pennsylvania, I didn’t plan on a career in IT—it just happened. I graduated from Penn State before some of my coworkers were born, earning a degree in Quantitative Business Analysis. Years later, I’ve mostly used it to confirm that college is excellent at teaching theory, networking, and how to figure things out on the fly.</p>
