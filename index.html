    <p>African penguins are sometimes called “jackass penguins” because they make loud, donkey-like braying sounds to communicate with each other!
These vocal calls help mates find one another and warn off rivals — pretty noisy for such cute birds. We in IST sometimes refer to grad students as "African Penguins"... for different reasons.</p>
